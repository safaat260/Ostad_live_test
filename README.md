      Question
You are given a list of students. Each student has a name and a list of scores. Your task is to:
Calculate the average score of each student (rounded to 2 decimal places).
Store the results in a map, where the studentâ€™s name is the key and their average score is the value.
Sort the map in descending order of average scores and print the final sorted result.

           Sample Input:
[
{"name": "Alice", "scores": [85, 90, 78]},
{"name": "Bob", "scores": [88, 76, 95]},
{"name": "Charlie", "scores": [90, 92, 85]}
];
              Output:
{
"Charlie": 89.0,
"Bob": 86.33,
"Alice": 84.33
}
